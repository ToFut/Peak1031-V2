Looking at the current chat implementation, it has some good features but isn't quite "next gen" yet. Here's an honest
  assessment:

  Current Features âœ…

  - Real-time messaging via WebSocket subscriptions
  - File attachments
  - Read receipts
  - Typing indicators
  - Multi-participant exchanges
  - Role-based access control

  What's Missing for "Next Gen" ðŸš€

  1. Rich Media & Formatting

  - No markdown support
  - No code syntax highlighting
  - No emoji picker
  - No GIF support
  - No voice messages
  - No video calls

  2. Advanced Collaboration

  - No message threading/replies
  - No message reactions
  - No @mentions
  - No message editing
  - No message deletion
  - No pinned messages

  3. Smart Features

  - No message search
  - No chat history export
  - No automated notifications
  - No chatbots/AI assistance
  - No translation
  - No smart suggestions

  4. UI/UX Polish

  - No message grouping by time
  - No "seen by" indicators for groups
  - No offline message queue
  - No push notifications
  - No dark mode support
  - No mobile optimization

  5. Performance

  - No message pagination/lazy loading
  - No message caching
  - No optimistic UI updates
  - Loads all messages at once

  To make it truly "next gen", you'd want features like:
  - AI-powered features: Smart replies, summarization, sentiment analysis
  - Rich collaboration: Threads, reactions, polls, shared documents
  - Advanced media: Screen sharing, voice/video, whiteboards
  - Productivity: Reminders, tasks from chat, calendar integration
  - Analytics: Engagement metrics, response times

  The current implementation is a solid foundation but more like a "standard modern chat" than "next gen". Want me to
  implement some of these advanced features?
