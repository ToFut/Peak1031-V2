# Message Viewing Permission Issue Analysis

## Problem Description
Users are receiving the error: "You do not have permission to view messages in this exchange" when trying to access messages in an exchange.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Database Column
The primary issue is that the `exchange_participants` table is missing the `is_active` column that the code expects. The RBAC service and permission middleware are filtering by `is_active = true`, but this column doesn't exist in the current database schema.

### 2. User-Contact Relationship Issues
The permission system relies on a complex relationship between:
- `users` table (internal system users)
- `contacts` table (external contacts, including clients)
- `exchange_participants` table (junction table linking users/contacts to exchanges)

For client users, the system needs to:
1. Find the user's contact record (by email)
2. Check if that contact is a participant in the exchange
3. Verify the participant has `can_view_messages` permission

### 3. Permission Flow
The message viewing permission check follows this flow:
1. User authenticates and has a role (client, coordinator, admin, etc.)
2. System checks if user is a participant in the specific exchange
3. If participant exists, check their specific permissions
4. If no participant record, fall back to role-based default permissions
5. RBAC service also checks if user can access the exchange at all

## Files Involved

### Backend Files
- `backend/routes/messages.js` - Message routes with permission middleware
- `backend/middleware/exchangePermissions.js` - Permission checking middleware
- `backend/services/rbacService.js` - Role-based access control service
- `backend/models/Exchange.js` - Exchange model
- `backend/models/Message.js` - Message model

### Database Files
- `database/migrations/004-create-exchange-participants.sql` - Original table creation
- `database/migrations/030-add-is-active-to-exchange-participants.sql` - Fix for missing column

## Solution

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the migration to add the missing `is_active` column:

```sql
-- Run this migration
ALTER TABLE exchange_participants 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_exchange_participants_is_active 
ON exchange_participants(is_active);

UPDATE exchange_participants 
SET is_active = true 
WHERE is_active IS NULL;
```

### 2. Use Diagnostic Script
Run the diagnostic script to identify specific issues:

```bash
node backend/scripts/debug-message-permissions.js <user_email> <exchange_id>
```

This will show:
- User details and role
- Contact relationship
- Exchange participant records
- Permission settings
- RBAC access status

### 3. Use Fix Script
Run the fix script to automatically resolve common issues:

```bash
node backend/scripts/fix-message-permissions.js <user_email> <exchange_id>
```

This will:
- Create missing contact records
- Add user as exchange participant
- Set appropriate permissions
- Verify the fix

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Missing Contact Record
**Symptoms**: User exists but no contact record found
**Fix**: Script will create contact record automatically

### Issue 2: User Not Participant
**Symptoms**: User has no participant record in exchange
**Fix**: Script will add user as participant with appropriate role

### Issue 3: Missing Permissions
**Symptoms**: User is participant but lacks `can_view_messages` permission
**Fix**: Script will update participant permissions

### Issue 4: Inactive Participant
**Symptoms**: Participant record exists but `is_active = false`
**Fix**: Update participant record to set `is_active = true`

## Manual Database Queries

### Check User's Contact Record
```sql
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Check Exchange Participants
```sql
SELECT ep.*, c.email, u.email as user_email
FROM exchange_participants ep
LEFT JOIN contacts c ON ep.contact_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON ep.user_id = u.id
WHERE ep.exchange_id = 'exchange-uuid-here'
AND ep.is_active = true;
```

### Add User as Participant
```sql
INSERT INTO exchange_participants (
    exchange_id, 
    contact_id, 
    role, 
    permissions, 
    is_active
) VALUES (
    'exchange-uuid-here',
    'contact-uuid-here',
    'client',
    '{"can_view_messages": true, "can_send_messages": true}',
    true
);
```

### Update Participant Permissions
```sql
UPDATE exchange_participants 
SET permissions = permissions || '{"can_view_messages": true}'::jsonb
WHERE id = 'participant-uuid-here';
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Run diagnostic script** to identify the issue
2. **Run fix script** to resolve the issue
3. **Test message access** in the frontend
4. **Verify permissions** work for different user roles

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Ensure all migrations run** when setting up new environments
2. **Add user as participant** when creating exchanges
3. **Set appropriate permissions** based on user role
4. **Test permission flows** for all user types
5. **Monitor permission errors** in logs
