# Frontend-Supabase Integration Guide

## Overview
The frontend has been updated to use Supabase directly instead of mock data. Here's what has been changed:

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Integration
- Updated `useAuth.tsx` to use the API service's Supabase authentication methods
- The API service (`api.ts`) already has Supabase integration built-in
- Authentication now uses Supabase Auth with proper user profile handling

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env` file in the frontend directory with Supabase credentials
- Updated `supabase.ts` to use environment variables

### 3. API Service Configuration
- The API service is configured to use Supabase (not mock data)
- All CRUD operations for users, exchanges, tasks, documents, and messages use Supabase

## Database Setup Required

Before using the application, you need to apply the SQL fixes to your Supabase database:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project (ynwfrmykghcozqnuszho)

2. **Apply the Final RLS Fix**
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy the contents of `supabase-final-rls-fix.sql`
   - Execute the SQL to:
     - Drop all existing policies
     - Create new non-recursive policies
     - Ensure admin user exists

3. **Apply Seed Data (Optional)**
   - If you want sample data, execute `supabase-seed-final.sql`
   - This will create sample exchanges, tasks, users, etc.

## Testing the Integration

1. **Start the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Login Credentials**
   - Email: `admin@peak1031.com`
   - Password: `Admin123!@#`

3. **Verify Integration**
   - Login should work with Supabase Auth
   - Dashboard should load real data from Supabase
   - All CRUD operations should work

## Features Status

### ✅ Completed
- Supabase authentication
- User profile management
- API service integration
- Environment configuration

### ⏳ Pending
- Real-time subscriptions (Socket.IO to Supabase Realtime)
- File upload/download with Supabase Storage
- Two-factor authentication
- User registration flow

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues
1. Ensure the SQL fixes have been applied
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Supabase credentials in `.env`

### Data Not Loading
1. Check if RLS policies are correctly applied
2. Verify user has proper role in database
3. Check browser network tab for API errors

### Next Steps
1. Apply the SQL fixes to Supabase
2. Test all user roles (admin, client, coordinator, etc.)
3. Implement real-time features with Supabase subscriptions
4. Set up file storage with Supabase Storage
