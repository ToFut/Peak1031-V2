/**
 * Fix for existing user invitation flow
 * 
 * Current Issue:
 * - When inviting an existing user, they're added directly as a participant
 * - This means they don't show in "Pending Invitations"
 * - User sees the invitation briefly, then it disappears after render
 * 
 * Options:
 * 1. Always create invitation records (even for existing users)
 * 2. Show participants who haven't accepted yet as "pending"
 * 3. Track acceptance status separately
 */

const SOLUTION = `
The current behavior is actually correct from a business logic perspective:
- Existing users are immediately added to the exchange
- They don't need to "accept" since they already have accounts

However, for better UX, we should:
1. Still show them temporarily in the UI after sending
2. Display them in the "Exchange Users" tab instead
3. Send them a notification that they've been added

To fix the display issue:

const frontendFix = `
// In EnhancedInvitationManager.tsx

// After sending invitations, if the user exists:
1. They will show in results as 'added_existing_user'
2. Auto-switch to 'users' tab instead of 'pending' for existing users
3. Show a different success message

// Modify the handleSendInvitations function:
if (result.results.successful.length > 0) {
  const hasExistingUsers = result.results.some(r => r.status === 'added_existing_user');
  const hasNewInvitations = result.results.some(r => r.status === 'invitation_sent');
  
  if (hasExistingUsers && !hasNewInvitations) {
    // All were existing users - switch to users tab
    await fetchParticipants();
    setActiveTab('users');
    setSuccessMessage('Users have been added to the exchange');
  } else if (hasNewInvitations) {
    // Some or all were new invitations
    await fetchInvitations();
    setActiveTab('pending');
  }
}
`;

const backendAlternative = `
// Alternative: Create invitation records for existing users too
// This would require changing the logic in /backend/routes/invitations.js

if (existingUser) {
  // Create invitation record even for existing users
  const invitationRecord = await supabaseService.insert('invitations', {
    id: uuidv4(),
    email: invitation.email,
    exchange_id: exchangeId,
    role: invitation.role,
    invited_by: inviterId,
    invitation_token: crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'),
    expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
    status: 'auto_accepted', // New status for existing users
    accepted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    user_id: existingUser.id,
    created_at: new Date().toISOString()
  });
  
  // Then add as participant...
}
