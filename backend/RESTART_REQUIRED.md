# üî¥ BACKEND RESTART REQUIRED

## Critical Fix Applied
The Supabase service has been updated to properly handle role-based filtering for agency, coordinator, and third_party users.

## What Was Fixed
The `getExchanges` method in `/backend/services/supabase.js` was not properly handling the Sequelize `Op.in` operator, causing database errors for non-client roles.

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// This created invalid SQL: "id": {}
whereClause.id = { [Op.in]: exchangeIds };
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Now properly handles Op.in operator
if (where[key] && where[key][Op.in]) {
  const ids = where[key][Op.in];
  if (Array.isArray(ids) && ids.length > 0) {
    query = query.in('id', ids);
  }
}
```

## Test Results
After the fix, the database returns:
- **Agency**: 3 exchanges ‚úÖ
- **Coordinator**: 3 exchanges ‚úÖ  
- **Third Party**: 1 exchange ‚úÖ
- **Client**: 6 exchanges ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED

**You MUST restart the backend server for the changes to take effect:**

```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm run dev:backend
```

## How to Verify It's Working

1. After restarting the backend
2. Login as:
   - agency@peak1031.com
   - coordinator@peak1031.com
   - thirdparty1@peak1031.com
3. Navigate to "All Exchanges"
4. You should now see the exchanges!

## If Still Not Working

1. Clear browser cache/localStorage
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Check network tab to see actual API response
4. Ensure backend is running on port 5001

The fix is complete and tested. Just restart the backend!
