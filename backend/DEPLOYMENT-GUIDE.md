   - Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to your project
   - Go to: **SQL Editor** > **New Query**

2. **Copy and Paste Complete Schema**
   - Copy the entire content from: `/database/migrations/200_comprehensive_optimized_schema.sql`

- ✅ Fetch **7,153 exchanges** with ALL PP matter fields + chat system
- ✅ Fetch **3 tasks** with complete PP task integration

## Step 3: Verification ✅

After deployment, verify:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Verify PP data
SELECT COUNT(*) as contacts FROM contacts WHERE pp_id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) as exchanges FROM exchanges WHERE pp_matter_id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) as tasks FROM tasks WHERE pp_id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) as invoices FROM invoices WHERE pp_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Check chat system
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'exchange_chat%';
```

## Expected Results 📈

After successful deployment and sync:

```
📊 Sync Status:
✅ contacts     - 11,191 records | All PP fields mapped
✅ exchanges    - 7,153 records  | Complete PP matter integration + chat_id

✅ invoices     - 2,500 records  | Complete PP invoice data

🎯 Total: ~21,000 records with comprehensive field mapping
```

## Next Steps 🔄

1. **Deploy schema** → Run migration in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Sync PP data** → Run `node scripts/test-comprehensive-sync.js`
3. **Verify results** → Check record counts and field mapping
