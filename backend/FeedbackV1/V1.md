Milestone 1	Foundation, Authentication & Sync	Is the login process (emai, 2FA) simple, secure, and reliable for all users?	Part – Works smoothly; 2FA to implmenet	Login was fine for me. It didn't prompt me to set up a 2FA though.																					
		Does the dashboard show only relevant information for each role, with urgent tasks and deadlines clearly visible?		I sent an email with some potential categories to add to the admin dashboard. The admin dashboard has more technical information that doesn't concern me as much. Better to get feedback from Eli and Kevin regarding the technical metrics they want displayed. Stuff relating to performance and efficiency, etc.
