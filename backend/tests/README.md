## 🛠 **Development Usage**

### **Adding New Tests**
1. Create new test file in `feature-tests/` directory
2. Follow the existing pattern with `recordTest()` function
3. Add to the main runner in `run-all-feature-tests.js`
4. Update this README with new test coverage

### **Debugging Tests**
```bash
# Enable debug mode
DEBUG=true node tests/feature-tests/user-management-test.js

# Test single feature with verbose output
node tests/run-all-feature-tests.js --tests=user 2>&1 | tee debug.log
```

### **CI/CD Integration**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Feature Tests
  run: |
    cd backend
    npm install
    node tests/run-all-feature-tests.js --quick
  env:
    BACKEND_URL: ${{ secrets.BACKEND_URL }}
    TEST_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.TEST_EMAIL }}
    TEST_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TEST_PASSWORD }}
```

## 🎭 **Test Data Management**

### **Automatic Cleanup**
All test suites automatically:
- Create test users with unique emails
- Clean up created test data after completion
- Use isolated test data that doesn't affect production

### **Test User Patterns**
- `test-[feature]-[role]@peak1031.com` - Feature-specific test users
- Passwords follow pattern: `Test[Role]123!`
- All test users are deleted after test completion

### **Test Exchange Data**
- Tests use existing exchanges or create temporary ones
- Test documents are uploaded and cleaned up
- Test messages are sent to isolated exchange rooms

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Backend Connection Errors**
```
❌ Backend server check failed: connect ECONNREFUSED
```
**Solution**: Ensure backend server is running on correct port
```bash
cd backend && npm run dev
```

#### **Authentication Failures**
```
❌ Admin authentication failed: Invalid credentials
```
**Solution**: Verify admin user exists and credentials are correct
```bash
# Create admin user
node scripts/create-admin.js
```

#### **Socket.IO Connection Issues**
```
❌ Admin Socket Connection - connect_error
```
**Solution**: Check if Socket.IO is enabled in backend server and ports are open

#### **Database Permissions**
```
❌ Create Test Client User - permission denied
```
**Solution**: Ensure admin user has proper permissions and database is accessible

### **Test Execution Speed**
- **Full Suite**: ~3-5 minutes (comprehensive testing)
- **Quick Mode**: ~30-60 seconds (lightweight testing)
- **Individual Feature**: ~30-90 seconds per feature

### **Resource Requirements**
- **Memory**: ~100MB for test execution
- **Network**: Requires backend server connection
- **Disk**: ~10MB for temporary test files and reports
- **Database**: Creates/deletes ~10-20 test records per run

## 📈 **Success Criteria**

### **Feature Acceptance**
- ✅ **95%+ Success Rate**: Individual features should pass 95% or more tests
- ✅ **All Critical Paths**: Authentication, core CRUD, role-based access must pass
- ✅ **No Crashes**: Test suites should complete without crashing
- ✅ **Clean Cleanup**: All test data should be properly removed

### **Overall Platform Health**
- ✅ **90%+ Overall Rate**: Platform should achieve 90%+ success across all features
- ✅ **All Features Tested**: All 7 major features should have test coverage
- ✅ **Performance**: Tests should complete within reasonable time limits
- ✅ **Stability**: Multiple test runs should produce consistent results

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run Initial Test Suite**: Execute full test suite to establish baseline
2. **Fix Failing Tests**: Address any failing tests before deployment
3. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Add to continuous integration pipeline
4. **Schedule Regular Runs**: Set up automated testing schedule
5. **Extend Coverage**: Add more comprehensive tests for advanced features
