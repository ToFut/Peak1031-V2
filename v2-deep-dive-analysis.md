# Peak1031 V2 Backend - Deep Dive Analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

V2 represents a **complete backend rewrite** with enterprise-grade architecture:

### Current vs V2 Comparison:
| Feature | Current V1 | V2 |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Auth System | Basic JWT | Hybrid (Supabase + JWT) |
| Security | Basic | Enterprise RBAC + Rate limiting |
| Database | Direct queries | Service layer abstraction |
| Business Logic | Mixed in routes | Dedicated service classes |
| Monitoring | Basic logging | Comprehensive audit system |
| Testing | None | Full test suites |

## 🔐 Major Security Enhancements

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
```javascript
const permissions = {
  admin: ['*'],
  coordinator: ['exchanges:read', 'exchanges:write', 'documents:read', ...],
  client: ['exchanges:read', 'documents:read', 'messages:read', ...],
  third_party: ['exchanges:read', 'documents:read'],
  agency: ['exchanges:read', 'documents:read', 'messages:read']
};
```

### 2. **Advanced Security Configuration**
- JWT with refresh tokens (15min + 7d)
- Password complexity requirements
- Rate limiting (100 requests/15min)
- Login attempt protection (5 attempts, 15min lockout)
- File upload restrictions (10MB, specific MIME types)

### 3. **Hybrid Authentication**
- Supports both Supabase and local JWT
- Automatic fallback system
- Session management improvements

## 🚀 Business Logic Improvements

### 1. **Exchange Workflow Service**
Automated 1031 exchange lifecycle management:

```javascript
statusWorkflow = {
  'Draft' → ['In Progress', 'Cancelled'],
  'In Progress' → ['45-Day Period', 'Cancelled', 'On Hold'],
  '45-Day Period' → ['180-Day Period', 'Cancelled', 'On Hold'],
  '180-Day Period' → ['Completed', 'Cancelled', 'On Hold']
}
```

**Auto-generated tasks for each stage:**
- Draft: Collect client info, identify property, prepare agreement
- 45-Day: Identify replacement properties, submit notices
- 180-Day: Complete acquisitions, finalize documentation

### 2. **Enhanced Models**
New database schema with:
- PracticePanther integration fields
- Comprehensive exchange lifecycle tracking
- Better relationship management
- Audit trail support
