## 🔐 **Deep User Management Per Exchange**

### **1. EXCHANGE PARTICIPANTS TABLE**
Controls who can access each exchange chat:

```sql
-- Each user-exchange relationship is managed separately
exchange_participants:
  - exchange_id: Which exchange
  - contact_id: Which user  
  - role: 'client', 'coordinator', 'third_party', 'agency', 'admin'
  - permissions: ['view', 'message', 'upload', 'manage']
  - is_active: Can be disabled without removing user
```

**Example Data:**
```sql
-- Exchange 123: Real Estate Deal A
INSERT INTO exchange_participants VALUES
(uuid1, 'exchange-123', 'user-john', 'client', ['view','message','upload']),
(uuid2, 'exchange-123', 'user-sarah', 'coordinator', ['view','message','upload','manage']),
(uuid3, 'exchange-123', 'user-escrow', 'third_party', ['view','message']);

-- Exchange 456: Real Estate Deal B  
INSERT INTO exchange_participants VALUES
(uuid4, 'exchange-456', 'user-mary', 'client', ['view','message','upload']),
(uuid5, 'exchange-456', 'user-mike', 'coordinator', ['view','message','upload','manage']);
```

### **2. MESSAGES TABLE**
Each message belongs to ONE exchange only:

```sql  
messages:
  - id: Message ID
  - exchange_id: Which exchange chat (CRITICAL - isolates conversations)
  - sender_id: Who sent it
  - content: Message text
  - attachments: File attachments array
  - read_by: Who has read it [{"user_id": "123", "read_at": "timestamp"}]
```

## 🚦 **Permission-Based Chat Access**

### **Access Control Matrix:**
| Role | View Messages | Send Messages | Upload Files | Manage Chat | Admin Functions |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Client** | ✅ Own exchanges | ✅ Own exchanges | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Coordinator** | ✅ Assigned exchanges | ✅ Assigned exchanges | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |  
| **Third Party** | ✅ Assigned exchanges | ✅ Assigned exchanges | ❌ View only | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Agency** | ✅ Assigned exchanges | ✅ Assigned exchanges | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Admin** | ✅ ALL exchanges | ✅ ALL exchanges | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

### **Row Level Security (RLS):**
```sql
-- Users can ONLY see messages in exchanges they're assigned to
CREATE POLICY messages_access ON messages  
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (
  -- Check if user is assigned to this exchange
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM exchange_participants ep
    WHERE ep.contact_id = (SELECT id FROM contacts WHERE email = auth.email())
    AND ep.exchange_id = messages.exchange_id
    AND ep.is_active = true
  ) 
  OR
  -- OR user is admin (sees all)
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM contacts
    WHERE email = auth.email() AND role = 'admin'  
  )
);
```

## 💡 **Real-World Chat Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Client John's View**
- John is assigned to **Exchange 123** as 'client'

### **Scenario 2: Coordinator Sarah's View**  
- Sarah is assigned to **Exchange 123** as 'coordinator'
- Sarah can:
  - ✅ See all messages in Exchange 123
  - ✅ Send messages, upload files
  - ✅ Manage chat (pin messages, etc.)
  - ✅ Add/remove participants (if permitted)
  - ❌ Cannot see other exchanges unless assigned

## 🔄 **Dynamic Participant Management**

### **Adding Users to Exchange Chat:**
```sql
-- Function to assign user to exchange (includes chat access)
SELECT assign_user_to_exchange(
    'exchange-123',           -- Exchange ID
    'user-newperson',         -- User to add  
    'third_party',            -- Their role
    'admin-user-id',          -- Who is adding them
    ARRAY['view','message']   -- Their permissions
);
```

### **Removing Users from Exchange Chat:**
```sql
-- Deactivate (soft delete - preserves message history)
UPDATE exchange_participants 
SET is_active = false 
WHERE exchange_id = 'exchange-123' AND contact_id = 'user-to-remove';
```

### **Changing User Permissions:**
```sql
-- Upgrade third_party to allow file uploads
UPDATE exchange_participants 
SET permissions = ARRAY['view','message','upload']
WHERE exchange_id = 'exchange-123' AND contact_id = 'user-id';
```

## 📱 **Frontend Implementation Guide**

### **Chat Component Structure:**
```typescript
// Each exchange gets its own chat component
<ExchangeChat exchangeId="123">
  <MessageList exchangeId="123" />          // Only messages for this exchange
  <ParticipantsList exchangeId="123" />     // Only assigned participants  
  <MessageInput exchangeId="123" />         // Send to this exchange only
  <FileUpload exchangeId="123" />           // Upload to this exchange
</ExchangeChat>
```

### **API Endpoints:**
```javascript
// Get messages for specific exchange (RLS enforced)
GET /api/exchanges/123/messages
  
// Send message to specific exchange
POST /api/exchanges/123/messages

// Get participants for exchange  
GET /api/exchanges/123/participants

// Add participant to exchange
POST /api/exchanges/123/participants
```
