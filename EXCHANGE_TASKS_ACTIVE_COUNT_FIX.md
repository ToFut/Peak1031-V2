# Exchange Tasks Active Count Fix âœ…

## Problem Identified
The "Active Tasks" count was showing 0 despite having 52 tasks in the database.

## Root Cause Found ðŸŽ¯

The issue was in the **status filtering logic** for counting active tasks. The code was only looking for tasks with status `'PENDING'` (uppercase), but the database contains tasks with mixed case statuses:

- `"pending"` (lowercase) - 44 tasks
- `"PENDING"` (uppercase) - some tasks
- `"IN_PROGRESS"` - 4 tasks
- `"COMPLETED"` - 4 tasks

## Solution Implemented âœ…

### Fixed Status Filtering Logic
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/ExchangeDetailsPage.tsx`

**Before**:
```javascript
tasks.filter(t => t.status === 'PENDING').length
```

**After**:
```javascript
tasks.filter(t => t.status === 'PENDING' || t.status === 'pending').length
```

### Locations Fixed:
1. **Active Tasks count display** (line 741)
2. **Admin role details** (line 335)
3. **Coordinator role details** (line 337)

### Enhanced Debug Information
Added "Active tasks count" to the debug panel to show the filtered count.

## Expected Results âœ…

After the fix:
- **Active Tasks count**: Should show 44 (pending tasks)
- **Total Tasks**: 52 tasks
- **TaskBoard display**: Should show all tasks in their respective columns

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/pages/ExchangeDetailsPage.tsx`
- âœ… Fixed status filtering to handle both `'PENDING'` and `'pending'`
- âœ… Updated all locations where active tasks are counted
- âœ… Added active tasks count to debug panel

## Current Status

### âœ… Backend Working:
- API returning 52 tasks correctly
- Status filtering working in TaskBoard component

### âœ… Frontend Fixed:
- Active tasks count now includes both case variations
- Debug information enhanced
- All status filtering locations updated

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:
The "Active Tasks" count should now show 44 instead of 0, and the TaskBoard should display all tasks correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh the exchange page** to see the updated Active Tasks count
2. **Check the debug panel** to verify the active tasks count
3. **Verify TaskBoard display** shows all tasks in their columns

---

**The fix is complete!** ðŸŽ‰

The issue was that the status filtering was case-sensitive and only looking for uppercase 'PENDING', but the database contains lowercase 'pending' statuses. This has now been fixed to handle both cases.
